1. diff b/w HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1
 HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded,
it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single 
TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

HTTP1.1 is the usest work on the textual format.
it compreses data by itself. 

HTTP/2 it works on the binary protocol.
it uses HPACK data for  compression.


2. Blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s
primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these
primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned
a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.
The variables don’t actually store the value.
